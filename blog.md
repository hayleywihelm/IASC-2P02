## A Blog About Text Analysis

### Abstract
This blog is an examination of text analysis, specifically focusing on its use in literature and its relation to the user. While inspecting this topic I will focus on the feminist approach to topic modelling tools, such as Voyant, as well as touching on a woman's use of these tools and their 'place' within this online environment. By taking a feminist approach to text analysis, I hope to show the complications within this setting by referencing academic papers by Johanna Drucker, paying attention to her response towards points mentioned by Franco Moretti in his journal 'Graphs, Maps, Trees'. I will also be concentrating on ideas made by Lisa Marie Rhody in regards to her ideas of re-visioning text analysis.
