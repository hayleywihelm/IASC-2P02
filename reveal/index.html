			<h2>Media Archaeology & The N-Gage</h2>
				<p>Jussi Parikka identifies the 'punk' aspects of technological development and analyzes the ways
				that we can think about material media cultures in historical perspective.  </p>
			</section>
			
			<section data-background-image="https://cdn.allwallpaper.in/wallpapers/2880x1800/13547/light-minimalistic-soft-shading-gradient-background-2880x1800-wallpaper.jpg">
			<h4> Media Archaeology </h4>
				<h5>Jussi Parikka also studies the idea of 'Zombie Media,' the living-dead of digital media. 
				Zombie media refers to the forgotten or out-of-use technologies which we analyze in order to understand the nature of technology development. 
				This media is important to us, as it allows us to examine the pros and cons of past digital devices and revise them to suit today's technical advancements.
				This also allows us to see the effects of technology in our lives and the trends it creates within an environment. 
				For example, using media archaeology on the N-Gage, allows us to see the technical issues with the device in regards to its usability and functions.</h5>

			<h3>How can we learn?</h3>
			<p> Through careful examination, we can see the social impacts of the N-Gage within the early 2000's. The device provided users with a mobile form of contemporary technology, which was still a fairly new concept at the time.
			When looking at the N-Gage, we need to ensure we see the effects of the device's features in regards to the functionality of the device.
			Although future devices, such as the iPhone, do not really reflect the design aspect of this device, we can see how this device influenced our popular forms of entertainment today. 
			We must ensure that we remember to think about the positive and negative impacts of all of the devices features so that we can understand the full effect.</p>

			<h3>Key Features of The N-Gage</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The overall function: The N-Gage's advanced features brought a new form of revolutionary gaming to the world in 2003. The use of having a supply of popular games, such as Sega's Sonic, attracted users to the device's capabilities.  </li>
					<li>The Buttons: The use of a d-pad and other control buttons, the N-Gage offered its users with many different gaming options. The use of the d-pad enhances gameplay and makes the user feel more connected to the device, as if it was an actual console controller.</li>
					<li>Cellphone Features: The side feature of calling offered users more to become attracted to. As you could only buy cellphones and consoles separately, this made buyers intrigued as the technology could offer more than just gameplay.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>When will we see something similar? </h3>
			<p>As mentioned earlier in my presentation, the iPhone is the closest relative of the Nokia N-Gage, as it offers users both gameplay and regular phone features. 
			However, with the iPhones advertising being targeted more towards the functionality of the phone rather than the games and gameplay it offers, it makes the device become labelled as a completely different product to the N-Gage. 
			We can see Apple Inc.'s attention to past technologies as they have avoided the technical design errors, such as the unnecessary buttons and features, seen in the N-Gage. Through this they have succeeded in the product design, functions and its usability.</p>
