### About Me

Hello! My name is Hayley Wilhelm and I am a current second year Interactive Arts and Science (IASC) student at Brock University. I am originally from the Cayman Islands and found myself applying to Brock U in St. Catharines late 2015. Within my 4 years at Brock I hope to develop my graphic design knowledge as well as to better my understanding of hardware and software within a computer system. In my classes, IASC 2P02 specifically, I hope to learn more about the uses of digital technogoly in other professions, such as geography and literature. Through the use of tools like Voyant and Github, I'll analyze literary texts by focusing on their geography and key terms/subject topics. 

As for my future, I hope to use my newly developed skill of project management to become a successful graphic designer. My love of technology and art has driven me to work my hardest and achieve my greatest within and outside of my schooling. I believe that this course will allow me to see the realtion between the geography of a company and their work in hopes of creating pieces that will also reflect their background. I hope that you enjoy my work published here!
