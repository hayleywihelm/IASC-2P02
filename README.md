### Bio

Hello! My name is Hayley Wilhelm and I am a current second year Interactive Arts and Science (IASC) student at Brock University. I am originally from the Cayman Islands and found myself applying to Brock U in St. Catharines late 2015. Within my 4 years at Brock, I hope to develop my graphic design knowledge as well as to better my understanding of hardware and software within a computer system. In my classes, IASC 2P02 specifically, I hope to learn more about the uses of digital technology in other professions, such as geography and literature. Through the use of tools like Voyant and Github, I plan to analyze literary texts by focusing on their geographical aspects, in addition to their key terms/subject topics. 

As for my future, I hope to use my newly developed skills within project management to become a successful graphic designer. My love of technology and art has driven me to work my hardest and achieve my greatest within and outside of my schooling. I believe that this course will allow me to see the the importance of the georgraphical components within a piece of work. I hope that, by using this, I will be able to create graphic design pieces that also relate to the clients geographical location. I hope that you enjoy my work published here!
